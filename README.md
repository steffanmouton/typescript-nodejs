## Application to Vivacity
#### Full Stack Developer

Hello there! This is my technical application to Vivacity. I am a full-stack developer located in the twin cities and I would love to have a chance to work with your team. 
I have done a lot of teaching in my life, including professionally, so I have the utmost respect for Vivacity's work in making computers available to students.

You can find the video walkthrough here: https://youtu.be/wR3mGSvb7s0

### Project Setup

Clone project from git.
Make a copy of `.example.env` at the root, name it `.env`, and fill in your information.

I've provided a couple scripts to help with setup on this application.

1. `npm run setupDB`
2. `npm run seed`
